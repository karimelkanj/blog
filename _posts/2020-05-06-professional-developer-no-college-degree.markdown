# Introduction
In our day and age, almost all the world is on lockdown and people are forced to stay at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tough times indeed. To make things worse, a lot more individuals are losing their jobs. What sort of jobs you might ask? Well, all sort of jobs are at risk. However, some might say that remote jobs offer more security to employees than any other job. 
One of the best ways to work remotely and have a high rewarding job is to become a Professional Developer. This guy can be a full stack developer, a cloud developer, a data scientist, or, in short words, anyone whose job basically involves writing code. In fact, a simple google search can show how much individuals are interested in shifting their careers towards becoming data scientists or machine learning engineers. The reason behind this is the fact that a lot of individuals are starting to consider moving towards a remote job that is both, high rewarding and can be executed anywhere without obstacles. The  idea of being able to execute all the job related tasks almost anywhere, and having a great salary is quite appealing to many. However, just how feasible can this idea be? Could, for example, civil engineers, graphic designers or accountants shift their careers and become professional developers at one point?

Thanks to the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2019, we can provide answers. This survey is conducted by Stack Overflow every year and it covers a wide variety of developer related information.
In order to provide a 'Yes or No' answer to our main question, three sub-questions need to be answered.
1. What makes this survey suitable for analysis?
2. What educational background do professional developers have? 
3. What is the best route to follow to become a professional developer?

## Question 1: What makes this survey suitable for analysis?
If we analyse the data provided in this survey, we can see that almost all the respondents are professional developers.

![Figure 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fig-1.png)

Figure 1 shows that more than 60,000 respondents indicated that they are developers by profession. This gives this analysis credibility and accuracy. For the purpose of this analysis, the focus will be on those individuals. Meaning that the data of the other respondents will be dropped to focus only on the developers with an actual job.

## Question 2: What educational background do professional developers have?

For this section, the rows containing anything other than 'developers by profession' are dropped, because we are interested in studying 'the working force', not everyone. 
The reasonable thing to do right now is to look at the educational background of those professional developers. What kind of degrees, if any, do they hold? In what discipline?

![Figure 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fig-2.png)

Straight away, from Figure 2, we can see that the majority of the professional developers hold either a Bachelor's degree or a Master's degree. This does not look great for individuals without a college degree. We can see that more than 75% of professional developers hold some form of College degree (Bachelor's, Master's or Doctoral degree). The remaining 25% goes to professional developers without any form of College degrees, which is a decent number. Yet, it is not convincing enough for people in order for them to change their careers. However, when we say 'hold some form of College degree', this basically includes every college discipline out there. The respondents could hold a college degree in civil engineering, accounting, finance or anything else. Even so the previous plot showed us that a college degree is, to some point, necessary for securing a job as a developer, does it need to be in a computer related field? 
To answer the previous question, we analysed the data describing the academic disciplines of the respondents with a profession as developers and presented the results in figure 3.

![Figure 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fig-3.png)

Alright then. As it appears from this plot, about 40,000 respondents hold a College degree in Computer related fields. In terms of percentages, figure 4 shows that this number accounts for about 66% of professional developers.

![Figure 4]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fig-4.png)

 While 66% seems like a big number, let's recap for a bit. About 75% of working developers hold a College degree, meaning that the remaining 25% are working without the help of a College degree. Moreover, about 35% of those with a College degree, undertook it in a discipline other than CS, CE or SE. If those numbers indicate anything, it's that shifting careers and becoming a professional developer is something, although not easy, but viable and achievable.
Perfect. Now we know that it's feasible. But wait a second, how did those individuals do it? The first thing that comes to mind when someone says 'developer' is long, endless and complicated lines of code.
How did they learn such thing?

## Question 3: What is the best route to follow to become a professional developer?
For this part, not only were the rows of unemployed developers dropped, the rows containing respondents with a College degree in CS, CE or SE were removed as well, in a way to understand what the remaining individuals actually did to learn coding.

![Figure 5]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fig-5.png)

Looking at figure 5, we can clearly see that the top two routes those individuals used are self-learning without formal courses and MOOCs. The two options have a lot of similarities. While the first one involves learning through reading books, browsing YouTube, checking blogposts or using any similar material, MOOCs are online courses that usually offers certificates of accomplishment upon their completion. Those two options together account for about 45% of all the other ways to learn to code, which makes those two options "The Way to Go".

# Conclusion
This analysis has shown that it is possible to work as a developer without a College degree in computer related fields. The best way to start is through investing in self learning from online resources or using MOOCs. Owing to the fact that the majority of the world is on lockdown, this could be the perfect opportunity for someone to start his journey to become a developer, and now that someone knows where to start.
